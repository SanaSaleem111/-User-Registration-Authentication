#User Registration Authentication
This solution implements a user registration and authentication system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes sign-up, login, and logout functionalities, each with form validation and session management. The sign-up form allows users to register by providing an email, password, and confirmation of the password. The form includes client-side JavaScript validation that ensures the email format is correct, the password is strong (at least 8 characters, with an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, and a number), and the passwords match. If any validation fails, appropriate error messages are displayed.
The login form lets users sign in using their email and password. Similar to the sign-up form, the login form also validates the email format and ensures the password meets basic length requirements. Once validated, a simulated login occurs, and the user's session is stored in the browser's localStorage. This session data enables the implementation of a simple logout function, which removes the session and redirects the user back to the login page.
The forms are styled using CSS to be visually appealing and responsive, ensuring they are easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices. The forms include error message placeholders to display messages like "Invalid email format" or "Passwords do not match." These error messages are shown dynamically based on the form validation results.
Lastly, the JavaScript handles both the form validation and the login/logout logic. The sign-up and login forms use event listeners to prevent default form submission, validate input, and either display error messages or proceed with a simulated form submission. The login success is simulated with a session being stored in localStorage, and the logout button becomes available if the user is logged in. This setup provides a basic but functional user authentication system that can be extended with server-side logic for a real-world application.
